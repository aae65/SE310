This is example code for abstracted input and output.

This code is not intended to be dropped into assignments without modification. The Console
 classes are not entirely without use, though they should be made more robust. The File
 and Audio classes need some work before they should be used to a deliverable.

 The audio jar files need to be added as a library to run the example driver:
 1. right click tts_lib
 2. select "Add as Library..."
 3. Click "OK" and add as library

 The audio jar files should now be included in your project and the example main should
 run as expected.

 ** NOTE **
 You can pass anything to the "say()" function from Out, the same way you would use System
 .out.println(). This means, anything that implements a toString() method will have proper
  output.

  This means, if you look at VehicleCityVersion/CodeProject/src/Driver.java you can 
  replace the print() function at the top of that file with the code here, and your outout
  is now abstracted. 
 ** END NOTE **
